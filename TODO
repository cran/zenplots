### TODO #######################################################################

- Bug under macOS (gdb fails):
  zenplots::zenplot(matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 5)) # then close the device => address 0xe0000060, cause 'memory not mapped' (dev.off() works, though)
- rownames of 'x' are lost after burst (maybe force it on every column?)
  *might* be a problem for time series
- Maybe we can speed-up the computation of a full Eulerian and (thus?) avoid the
  dependence on 'graph' and 'PairViz'?
- Fix all *_*_loon functions (see grid/graphics) for the use of 'loc' etc.
- Fix/adapt intro.Rmd + write paper (use cross2d() for showing ACFs and CCFs)


### New ideas/features #########################################################

- layout() (base graphics) has a limit of 10007 plots, see ?layout.
  pairs() doesn't have this limit, it uses par(mfrow =
  c(length(horInd), length(verInd))) instead. But we can't do that
  because width1d and width2d would not be respected then.
  (Even if so, we would loop over all rows and columns and figure out
  which plots contain which variables or work with par(mfg = ...) to
  plot in the right plot -- but that only works if all plots have the
  same scales ("global"))
- write gridMerge which essentially builds gTree(children = gList(plot1call, plot2call))
- be able to write plot1d = list(fun = c("hist", "density", "label"),
                                 args = list(fun1 = , fun2 = , fun3 = ))
  and get overlaid 1d plots (same for 2d)
